### Submitting Branches for Review 
###### (Remember, this is for finished products. Do not do this until it has been tested and probably looked at by someone else first)

1. Make sure any changes to the branch locally have been added, committed, and pushed up to github
2. Go to the GitHub page for the repository
3. Press the branches button under the repo description
4. On the branch you'd like to submit, press 'New pull request'
5. On this page, you can scroll down for an overview of changes made in your branch. If satisfied, click the green 'Create pull request' button
6. IMPORTANT!!! Do NOT click anything on the subsequent screen. Now that your request has been submitted, I will take a look at it. Exit the tab and wait until I contact you
